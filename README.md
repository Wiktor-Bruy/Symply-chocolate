# SIMPLY CHOCOLATE

This project was one of my first. It shows what a website for a company that produces and sells chocolate might look like. The project's structure is clearly divided into sections based on their respective themes. The site is responsive for various devices, with different styles applied to each. There's also a modal pop-up window where you can enter contact information.
